\usage{
read_and_filter(
  bug_file,
  metadata,
  pivot_wide = TRUE,
  minmax_thresh = 5,
  covariates = NULL,
  outcome = NULL,
  filtering_method = "kmeans",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{bug_file}{path to a gene family file (usually probably from HUMAnN)}

\item{pivot_wide}{logical indicating whether to return data in wide format}

\item{minmax_thresh}{genes must have at least this many (or N - this many)
non-zero observations or else be discarded}

\item{covariates}{covariates to account for (as a vector of strings)}

\item{outcome}{the name of the outcome variable}

\item{filtering_method}{either "kmeans" or "none"}

\item{discretize_inputs}{logical indicating whether to discretize the input
abundance measurements (0/nonzero --> FALSE/TRUE) before passing them to
the modelling function}

\item{discard_absent_samples}{Discard samples that are labelled as missing
the bug according to the filtering strategy (otherwise keep them as
observations of absence)}

\item{save_filter_stats}{logical indicating whether to save filter statistics}

\item{filter_stats_dir}{directory to save filtering statistics to}

\item{plot_ext}{extension to use for plots}
