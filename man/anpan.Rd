\arguments{
\item{bug_file}{path to a gene family file (usually from HUMAnN)}

\item{meta_file}{path to a metadata tsv}

\item{out_dir}{path to the desired output directory}

\item{genomes_file}{optional file giving gene presence/absence of representative isolate genomes}

\item{prefiltered_dir}{an optional directory to pre-filtered data from an earlier run to skip the
filtering step}

\item{model_type}{either "horseshoe" or "fastglm"}

\item{covariates}{covariates to account for (as a vector of strings)}

\item{outcome}{the name of the outcome variable}

\item{omit_na}{logical indicating whether to omit incomplete cases of the metadata}

\item{discretize_inputs}{logical indicating whether to discretize the input abundance
measurements (0/nonzero --> FALSE/TRUE) before passing them to the modelling function}

\item{minmax_thresh}{genes must have at least this many (or N - this many)
non-zero observations or else be discarded. NULL defaults to \code{floor(0.005*nrow(metadata))}.}

\item{skip_large}{logical indicating whether to skip bugs with over 5k genes. Only used when
model_type = "horseshoe".}

\item{save_fit}{logical indicating whether to save horseshoe fit objects. Only used when
model_type = "horseshoe".}

\item{discard_poorly_covered_samples}{logical indicating whether to discard samples where the genes of a bug are poorly covered}

\item{plot_ext}{extension to use for plots}

\item{save_filter_stats}{logical indicating whether to save filter statistics}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to [cmdstanr::sample()] if applicable}

\value{
a data.table of model statistics for each gene

\description{
Run the anpan gene model on a single bug
}
\details{
The specified metadata file must contain columns matching "sample_id" and the specified
  covariates and outcome variables.

  If provided, \code{genomes_file} is used to refine the filtering process. The format must be
  genes as rows, with the first column giving the gene id (usually a UniRef90 identifier), and
  subsequent columns representing isolate genomes. The entries of the isolate genome columns
  should give 0/1 indicators of whether or not the gene is present in the isolate. The gene
  counts present in these isolates are used to establish the typical number of genes present in a
  strain of the species and a lower threshold on the number of acceptable gene observations. If
  >=5 isolate genomes are available, the lower threshold is 2 standard deviations below the mean,
  otherwise it is 2/3 of the mean.
