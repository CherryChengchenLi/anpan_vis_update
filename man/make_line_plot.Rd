\usage{
make_line_plot(
  bug_file = NULL,
  meta_file = NULL,
  covariates,
  outcome,
  omit_na = FALSE,
  fgf = NULL,
  bug_name = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{bug_file}{a path to a gene family file}

\item{meta_file}{a path to the corresponding metadata file}

\item{covariates}{covariates to account for (as a vector of strings)}

\item{outcome}{the name of the outcome variable}

\item{omit_na}{logical indicating whether to omit incomplete cases}

\item{fgf}{a filtered gene family data frame}

\item{bug_name}{name of the bug}

\item{subset_line}{integer gives the number of points to take along the lines}
}
\description{
Make a filter-labelled line plot
}
\details{
The required input is either \itemize{ \item{the gene family file
  and the metadata file} \item{OR a pre-filtered gene family file}}
  \code{subset_line} is used to make saving plots faster. Plotting thousands
  of lines each with tens of thousands of points along them is too much
  visual detail and makes saving the plot very slow. Set \code{subset_line}
  to 0 to turn off subsetting.
