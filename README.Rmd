The goal of anpan is to consolidate statistical methods for strain analysis. This includes testing automated filtering of metagenomic functional profiles, genetic elements for association with outcomes, and phylogenetic association testing.

## Requirements

anpan currently depends on `rstan`, which means your R installation needs to be able to compile C++14 code. On Linux this means you will need to create a Makevars file if you don't already have one set up using the following R command (instructions for other operating systems can be found at [this link](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)):

```
dotR <- file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".R")
if (!file.exists(dotR)) dir.create(dotR)
M <- file.path(dotR, "Makevars")
if (!file.exists(M)) file.create(M)
cat("\nCXX14FLAGS=-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -fPIC",
    "CXX14=g++", # or clang++ but you may need a version postfix
    file = M, sep = "\n", append = TRUE)
```

The rstan dependency should hopefully be removed soon.

anpan requires the following R packages, most of which which can be installed from CRAN:

```
install.packages(c("ape", 
                   "brms", 
                   "data.table", 
                   "dplyr", 
                   "purrr", 
                   "tibble", 
                   "tidyr", 
                   "furrr", 
                   "ggnewscale",
                   "patchwork", 
                   "progressr",
                   "rstanarm",
                   "fastglm")) # add Ncpus = 4 to go faster

install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```

If the `cmdstanr` installation doesn't work you can find more detailed instructions [at this link](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). Once you've installed `cmdstanr`, you will need to use it to install CmdStan:

```
library(cmdstanr)
check_cmdstan_toolchain()
install_cmdstan(cores = 2)
```

## Installation

You can install anpan from github with:

``` r
devtools::install("biobakery/anpan")
```

## Example - element testing

You can filter large uniref tables and look for associations with outcomes (while controlling for covariates) with `anpan_batch`. Right now this only works for glm-based models.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

library(furrr) 
plan(multisession, workers = 2) # Run with two parallel R sessions on the local machine

library(progressr)
handlers(global=TRUE) # show progress bars for long computations

library(anpan)


anpan_batch(bug_dir = "/path/to/gene_families/",
            meta_file = "/path/to/metadata.tsv",
            out_dir = "/path/to/output",
            annotation_file = "/path/to/annotation.tsv", #optional, used for plots
            filtering_method = "kmeans",
            model_type = "fastglm",
            covariates = c("age", "gender"),
            outcome = "crc",
            plot_ext = "pdf",
            save_filter_stats = TRUE)
```

This will create the output directory with tables of regression coefficients, top-results plots, and filter statistics.

## Example - phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model

You can run a PGLMM with the `anpan_pglmm` function. This fits a model where the covariance matrix of outcomes is determined from the phylogenetic tree. Right now there's only gaussian outcomes, and no regularization on the covariance matrix.

```{r eval=FALSE}
meta_file = "/path/to/metadata.tsv" 
tree_file = "/path/to/file.tre"

anpan_pglmm(meta_file,
            tree_file,
            trim_pattern = "_bowtie2",
            covariates = NULL,
            plot_cov_mat = TRUE,
            outcome = "age",
            verbose = TRUE,
            cores = 4)
```

## FAQ

> What's with the name?

The name "anpan" was chosen to fit into the [biobakery](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/tools/) bread theme and because it's short and easy to pronounce and remember. Also, [real anpan](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=anpan&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images) are delicious.

There's no backronym, but if you think of a good one let me know.

Capitalization of the name follows [the xkcd rule](https://xkcd.com/about/). All lowercase "anpan" is preferred and all uppercase "ANPAN" is acceptable in formal contexts or the start of a sentence, but mixed-case "Anpan" should be avoided.
